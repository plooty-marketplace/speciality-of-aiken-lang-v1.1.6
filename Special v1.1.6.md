The specialty of Aiken Lang v1.1.6 compared to v1.1.5 typically includes enhancements in functionality, performance, and usability. While specific functions and code snippets are not available, updates often focus on refining language features, improving error handling, and possibly introducing new capabilities based on user feedback. Here are some hypothetical examples of functions that might be improved or added in v1.1.6:

### Step by step

1. Prepare Your Code for Deployment

-Environment Variables
 -Make sure all sensitive data (e.g., Blockfrost API keys) is stored in environment variables:
 -Rename .env to .env.production for production environments.
 
2. Build the React App

Run the following command to create a production-ready build of your React app:
...
npm run build
...

This will generate a build/ folder containing optimized files.

2. Choose a Hosting Platform
Here are three popular hosting options:

A. Vercel

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
 ...
npm install -g vercel
 ...
2. Deploy your app
...

   vercel

...
3. Follow the prompts, and Vercel will generate a live link for your app.

B. Netlify

Install the Netlify CLI:
...
npm install -g netlify-cli
...
Select the build/ folder when prompted

5. GitHub Pages

Install the GitHub Pages package:
...
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
...

Add the following scripts to your package.json:
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
...
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
...
npm run deploy
...

3. Backend/Server for Advanced Features
If you want to handle event notifications or integrate royalty distribution, you’ll need a backend. Here’s how:

1. Backend Setup

Use Node.js with Express.js to handle backend requests and listen for blockchain events.
Deploy the backend using Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.
Example Backend

const express = require("express");
const axios = require("axios");
const app = express();

// Replace with your Blockfrost API key
const BLOCKFROST_API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>";
const BLOCKFROST_URL = "https://cardano-testnet.blockfrost.io/api/v0";

app.get("/auction/:address", async (req, res) => {
  const scriptAddress = req.params.address;

  try {
    const { data } = await axios.get(`${BLOCKFROST_URL}/addresses/${scriptAddress}/utxos`, {
      headers: { project_id: BLOCKFROST_API_KEY },
    });
    res.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Error fetching auction data");
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Backend running on http://localhost:3000"));
4. Event Notifications
To notify users about events (e.g., a new bid or auction winner), you can:

5. Use Webhooks

Use a service like Zapier or build your webhook server to listen to events using the Blockfrost API.
Real-Time Notifications
Add WebSocket support using libraries like Socket.IO for instant notifications to users.

6. Monitor and Optimize
Use Analytics
Add Google Analytics or similar tools to monitor user interactions.
Error Reporting
Integrate services like Sentry to track errors in real time.
Optimize Performance
Ensure your hosting supports HTTPS.
Use a CDN for faster load times.
